I can't see past the brumous horizon, nor over the looming crags that seem to close in more and more each day. I know I can’t possibly get out there, and it’s soul-sucking having my world being confined to this ecological bubble… I need to find a way to get out...
\n\nI need to finally see what's been calling my voice, tricking my weary eyes, and invading my head with nightmarish dreams each night. Its been driving me crazy, telling me to take a dive, just jump in and swim around for a bit, to just relax and enjoy my time here. I cannot give in. I don't want to know what kind of thing would want an outsider to relax and let its guard down...\n\nI can't even see my reflection in the water...\nonly those mysterious crimson lights...\r\n<style=cMono>\r\nLocal audio transcriptions complete.\r\n<\/style>\r\n",
