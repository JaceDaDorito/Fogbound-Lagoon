## Fogbound Lagoon?
Fogbound Lagoon is an alternate Stage 3 which intends to bring a new experience to the game with its water mechanics, unique enemy pool, and atmosphere. It should fit in nicely with the other stages in the game stylistically and balance wise. This also serves as an example stage for (hopefully) any stages created in the future.

## Features

- Support for non-DLC players and DLC players. The interactable and monster pools will change depending on if SoTV is enabled.
- Four random newt statues.
- Working bazaar seer.
- Preon Accumulator Timed Chest similar to Rallypoint Delta. There are three spots.
- Water! You can float and so will the gups! Don't Die! No it doesn't have Minecraft anti-fall damage. It doesn't have drowning either.
- A new (DLC dependent) family event!
- Stage Aesthetic support.
- Spikestrip 2.0 support. Sigma Constructs spawn on the stage.
- Theres a funny guy hidden somewhere.

### Later down the road...

- Language translations. (Please message me on discord @JaceDaDorito if you are interested in doing language translations)
- Config options such as the DLC monster spawn pool being replaced by the normal one.
- Starstorm storm support.
- Bug fixes that crop up.

#### Uncertain
- Some vfx changes to make the stage look prettier.
- Custom Music? (This is a big maybe)

## Known Issues

- The water clipping certain vfx (specifically when they are coming out of the water into the water, and you are in the water) such as Xi Construct laser beam and Void Seeds. I think there is nothing I can do about this unless I write my own shader. If anyone is more knowledgable about calmwater shaders and know a solution let me know.
- Hank Sound effect clips off sometimes.
